* Advent of Learning Code
I try to learn new programming language by solving problems provided from [[https://adventofcode.com/][Advent of Code]].
I've only started from 2022 with [[https://go.dev/][Go Language]]. So far good

_Under-score_ means I've solved that day's problem.
** TODO Year 2022, [[https://go.dev/][Go Language]]:
