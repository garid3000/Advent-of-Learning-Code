* Advent of Learning Code
I try to learn new programming language by solving problems provided from [[https://adventofcode.com/][Advent of Code]].
I've only started from 2022 with [[https://go.dev/][Go Language]]. So far so good

- ~*~ means: I've solved that day's problem.
- ~!~ means: I've tried, but not solved yet.
